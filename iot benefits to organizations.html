<p>The internet of things gives companies several benefits. Some of the benefits are specific to industry, and some are applicable 
across multiple industries. Some of IoT's may benefits require undertakings to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><h2>Democratization of analytics</h2></li>
    <p> Organizations have had to build their own analytics in the past — spending their own time and money developing and testing their own algorithms. IoT's interconnectivity standards, however, mean a new market for pre-built analytics engines providing low-cost, plug-and - play access to the analytics needed to monitor specific types of markets, facilities, and asset classes. Through democratizing analytics — making it open to everyone, not just the big spenders who could afford to create their own — IoT is challenging the conventional market for consultancy and custom apps.</p>
  <li><h2> New business opportunities</h2></li>
    <p>Only 27 percent of business-to - business companies have a cohesive plan for adding value through digital transformation, according to Forrester; and a Gartner survey shows that CEOs expect digital services revenue to rise more than 80 percent by 2020.
The International Data Corporation ( IDC) describes this difference by forecasting the advent of the digital transformation (DX) economy. "As with the dot-com boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the digital transformation economy would produce completely new possibilities that never existed before.
 Gartner defines these new fields as goods and services "algorithmic" and "programmable," such as the aforementioned democratic analytics engines, cloud computing , artificial intelligence, and smart utility grids.
Traditional businesses will also benefit from using IoT to gather consumer feedback and use data to create innovative, forward-looking technologies that discover new value for consumers and implement it. For example, McKinsey suggests considering Tesla as "IoT on wheels," which gathers terabytes of data from its vehicles.</p>
  <li><h2>Safer and more productive work</h2></li>
    <p>IoT is going to change the overall place of work. Firstly, IoT can build new work, roles and skills to be learned by staff. Digital literacy and data analytics are becoming ever more relevant. As GE Chairman Jeff Immelt said, "If you went to bed last night as an engineering corporation, you would be waking up as a software and analytics corporation this morning."
Second, the IoT will make our workplaces safer. IoT-connected sensors will help us monitor confined and dangerous places and processes, eliminating danger to humansThen new perspectives can be found by correlating sensor and environmental data over time to better understand past events and reduce future risks.
The IoT will also create new ways in which staff can work together as a team. Many of us already live in a world where we receive work-related notifications on our phone, make a quick decision about how best to respond and press a button to delegate the action to the best party. While some view our ever-connected personal devices as a padlock to a 24-hour office panopticon, others regard the autonomy and versatility it offers as rewarding: a way to make your job fit into your life, rather than fitting your life into your work.
 That's why, in a Harvard Business Review survey, 58 per cent of respondents rated improved collaboration and flexibility as a benefit — not a burden.
The IoT would increase productivity overall. Much as robots replaced repetitive physical tasks, the "cognitive outsourcing" of the IoT would allow machines to be responsible for menial or repetitive mental tasks , allowing workers to spend more time seeking operational insights rather than gathering, analyzing and processing the data. The IoT also allows us to cross the generational divide — providing a way for millennials to transfer the expertise and institutional knowledge of retiring baby boomers to sleek and engaging work.</p>
  <li><h2> Process and behavior monitoring</h2></li>
    <p>IoT-enabled behavior monitoring is synonymous with near-real - time marketing in the consumer-facing market; however, business still benefits from monitoring activities of the people and processes.
As mentioned previously, consumer feedback and usage data from the IoT provide insight into customer preferences which will allow traditional industries to create new business opportunities.
Action monitoring helps companies to increase the quality and profitability of their workers. Analysts expect IoT-enabled near-real - time data on accidents , illnesses, absences, near-misses and incidents to make health, safety , and environmental concerns more timely and efficient in recognizing and isolating.</p>
  <li><h2> Process and resource optimization</h2></li>
    <p>Among the most widely appreciated of the advantages of IoT, IoT-enabled Big Data analytics provides many new avenues for enhancing operating efficiencies and helps improve the bottom line. By integrating historically separate data between business resource planning (ERP), product lifecycle management ( PLM), manufacturing execution (MES) and supplier relationship management (SRM) systems, IoT aligns the operation of your facility with its suppliers and customers and improves load forecasting and production scheduling.
  For example , consider an automated inventory management system that extends from the customer all the way to all levels of the supply chain. Historical and forecast demand can be viewed against processing times and the response time of suppliers – optimizing the loading of plants and taking just-in-time to a whole new level.
The IoT also allows monitoring of the quality in real time. Imagine identifying non-conformities before processing the piece or batch finish, and making automatic adjustments to the machine or process that improve quality, improve efficiency and reduce waste.</p>
  <li><h2>Better decision-making</h2></li>
    <p>Through shifting data from conventional silos, IoT strengthens situational understanding and empowers new contextual perspectives, resulting in quicker and better informed decision-making, and significant operational dividends.
Today, many analyzes of market cases and triggers for transactions are focused on spot-checked or average rates and thresholds of break even. This method is upended by IoT-enabled fast costing: receive time-based price signals, update your analyzes, evaluate tradeoffs and choose the optimal response.
IoT also allows an increased understanding of circumstances. Often referred to as cyber-physical development systems (CPPS), or IT and operational technology integration (IT / OT)these advanced analytics solutions provide new levels of visibility and control in complex systems.</p>
</ul>
<p>IoT allows organizations to reconsider how they conduct their markets and provide them with the resources they need to strengthen their business strategies.
In general, IoT is the most abundant in manufacturing , transportation and utility organizations, making use of sensors and other IoT devices; however, it has also found use cases for organizations in the agriculture, infrastructure and home automation sectors, moving some organizations towards digital transformation.
IoT can help agricultural farmers by making their work easier. Sensors can collect data on rainfall, humidity , temperature and soil content, as well as other factors that would help to automate agricultural techniques.
Another factor that IoT can help with is the ability to monitor operations surrounding infrastructure. For example, sensors could be used to monitor events or changes taking place within structural buildings , bridges and other infrastructure. This brings benefits, such as cost savings, time savings, improvements in the efficiency of the workflow and paperless workflow.
A home automation company may use IoT to control and manage in-build mechanical and electrical systems. Smart cities will help people reduce waste and energy use on a broader scale.
IoT covers every industry, including healthcare, banking , retail and manufacturing businesses.</p>
