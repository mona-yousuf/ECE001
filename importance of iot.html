 <h2>How iot helps us!</h2>
<p>The internet of things helps people to live and work smarter, and to gain full control over their lives. IoT is important for 
business as well as providing smart devices to automate homes. IoT provides companies with a real-time look at how their systems 
really work, providing insights into everything from machine performance to supply chain operations and logistics operations.

IoT helps businesses to simplify operations and increased labor costs. This also reduces waste and increases service quality ,
 making production and distribution of goods less costly, as well as providing consistency in consumer transaction.
As such, IoT is one of the most important innovations in everyday life and it will continue to pick up momentum as 
more businesses understand the ability of connected devices to keep them competitive.</p>
<p>The "Internet of Things " ( IoT) is now no longer the" hype "or a" buzzword, "it has the power to change our world. By Gartner's 50B connected devices by 2020, there is a clear sign that IoT can play an significant role in our everyday lives, which directly brings a related rise in cash flow. Nowadays, many companies are developing or rethinking their business models to validate how IoT can boost their competitive market growth. Through this article you can definitely see some fascinating IoT industry developments, and that will give you a glimpse of which areas can more incorporate IoT technologies and make a profit from them.
At AllThingsTalk by Both, the back-end and personalized front-end of the IoT Cloud, we serve with an intensive approach to a broad community while offering IoT cloud hardware, software and integration as a simple yet worthwhile education that can turn into your own business some day. We don't expect much, but instead provide you with what you need to start putting your ideas into effect. This may be for air quality , water quality, farm irrigation, etc. -- Just give it a name! That's why our work with you means a lot to us because it's a platform that addresses your needs, the positive results and some of the finish line targets.
I hope these developments below, which have been rising at the fastest so far, will help you understand what you should start thinking if you're in an IoT market.</p>
<h2>Smarter Natural Disaster Management</h2>
<p>The ability to anticipate, with fine-grained precision, the advent of conditions encouraging forest fires before they get out of control or even start, allows containment teams to respond quicker, while allowing first responders to better coordinate targeted evacuations and to be more coordinated with the actual situation in the field. This definition can also refer to better prediction of flooding and/or enhanced reaction to mudslides, avalanches, earthquakes and other natural disasters.</p>
<h2>Smarter Urban Management</h2>
<p>Cities and counties automate traffic management that efficiently monitors and controls traffic movements on the basis of ever-changing conditions; car parking systems that intelligently direct cars to open spaces, minimize waste of time and resources and significantly reduce emissions; automate large-scale electricity use, production and delivery, all with a view to mitigation.</p>
<h2>Smarter Healthcare</h2>
<p>Wearable devices that detect a host of health problems, potentially even before they occur, and administer life-saving drugs immediately or deploy emergency responders with detailed information instantly placed in their hands or alert family members as needed.
The ideas above barely skim the deep sea surface of opportunities offered by the coming IoT era, and here they all share a common (and not accidental) adjective: "smarter." If "smart" is characterized by the confluence of access to knowledge and the ability to use that knowledge in practical and effective ways, then the promise of the Internet of Things is simply a far "smarter" world that keeps us healthier, combines the personal good with the greater good, and increases the chances of the human race to provide future generations with a more prosperous legacy.</p>
