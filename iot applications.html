  <h2> Smart Home</h2>
<ul>
 <li><h3>August Home smart lock connected to the Internet</h3></li>
<p>Upgrade the deadbolt with the all-new Wi-Fi Smart Lock from August.
Lock or unlock the door remotely, check the status of the door, give virtual guest keys and see who is coming and going. And use your favorite voice assistant for door access. Our smart lock is simple to mount and connects the inside of your door to your existing deadbolt so that you can keep your original keys. And our lock needs no external bridge to connect with built-in Wi-Fi.</p>

<li><h3>A Nest learning thermostat reporting on energy usage and local weather</h3></li>
<p>Smart thermostats are thermostats that can be used with home automation to monitor the heating and/or air-conditioning of a house. They perform similar functions as a Programmable thermostat as they allow the user to monitor their home temperature during the day using a schedule, but they also contain additional features, such as sensors and WiFi connectivity, that improve the problems with programmable thermostats.</p>

<li><h3>A Ring doorbell connected to the Internet</h3></li>
<p>A smart doorbell is a doorbell connected to the internet that notifies the home owner's smartphone or other electronic device when a guest arrives at the door. This unlocks when the intruder clicks the doorbell button, or alternatively when the doorbell detects an intruder with incorporated motion sensors. The smart doorbell allows the home owner to use a mobile app to watch and speak to the visitor using the built-in high-definition infrarot camera and microphone from the doorbell.[1] Some smart doorbells also allow the user to remotely open the door using a smart lock</p>

 <h2>smart city</h2>
 <p>A smart city is a system, primarily composed of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), designed to create, implement and encourage sustainable development practices to address increasing challenges in urbanisation.
A significant part of this ICT architecture is basically a smart network of linked objects and machines that use wireless technology and the cloud to transfer data.
Cloud-based IoT systems obtain, evaluate, and handle data in real time to help municipalities, enterprises, and residents make better life-enhancing decision making.
Citizens are engaged in a variety of ways with smart city ecosystems using smartphones and mobile devices, and connected cars and homes. Pairing devices and data with physical infrastructure and services in a city can reduce costs and enhance sustainability.
With the help of the IoT, communities can improve energy distribution, streamline trash collection, reduce traffic congestion, and even improve air quality.</p>
