<h2>Definition of internet of things</h2>
<p>The Internet of Things ( IoT) is a collection of interrelated computing devices , mechanical and digital machines supplied with 
unique identifiers(UIDs) and the ability to transmit data over a network without needing human-to - human or human-to - computer
 interaction.Thanks to the integration of various technologies , real-time analytics, machine learning , commodity sensors and
 embedded devices,the concept of the Internet of things expanded.Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks ,
 control systems, automation (including home and construction automation), and others all contribute to the Internet of Things.
 In the consumer market, IoT technology is mostly synonymous with products related to the "smart home" definition, including
 devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures , thermostats , home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) 
 that support one or more common ecosystems and can be regulated through devices related to the ecosystem,
 such as smartphones and smart speakers.There are a number of serious concerns regarding the dangers of IoT production,Particularly
 in the areas of privacy and protection, and subsequently 
business and policy movements have begun to address these concerns.</p>

<h2>Trends and characteristics</h2>
<p>The major important trend of the IoT in recent years is the explosive growth of Internet-connected and controlled devices. The wide variety of IoT technology implementations means the details can be somewhat different from one system to another, but most share basic features.
The IoT provides incentives for more direct integration of the physical world in computer-based systems, leading to improvements in productivity, economic benefits and reduced human effort.
The number of IoT devices rose 31 per cent year-over-year to 8.4 billion in 2017[108] and it is predicted that 30 billion devices will be available by 2020[103]. IoT 's global market size is expected to hit $7.1 trillion by 2020.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Security is the biggest concern when it comes to embracing the Internet of Things Technology, with concerns that rapid growth takes place without sufficient consideration of the deep security issues involved and the regulatory changes that may be required.
Many of the technical security issues are common to traditional servers, workstations which smartphones[195] and include inadequate authentication, failing to adjust default passwords, unencrypted messages sent between devices, SQL injections and poor handling of software updates. Most IoT tools, however, have serious technical limitations on the computing capacity they possess.
Sometimes such limitations render them unable to use simple protection measures directly, such as installing firewalls or utilizing powerful cryptosystems to encrypt their interactions with other devices- and many devices' low price and market emphasis renders a comprehensive protection patching program uncommon.
Internet of Things systems will have access to new data areas and can also monitor physical objects, meaning that many Internet-connected devices could already "spy on people in their own homes" by 2014, including televisions, kitchen appliances, cameras and thermostats.
In automobiles such as brakes, ignition, locks, hood and trunk releases, horn, fire, and dashboard, computer-controlled devices have been shown to be vulnerable to on-board network access by attackers. In certain cases, computer systems for vehicles are connected to the Internet, allowing remote control of them. Security researchers had demonstrated by 2008 the ability without authority to remotely control pacemakers. Later hackers showed remote insulin pump control and implantable cardioverter defibrillators.</p>
