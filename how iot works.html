<P>An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded systems including processors, sensors, and communication
 hardware to capture, transmit, and act on data that they obtain from their environments. IoT devices share the sensor data obtained
 by connecting to an IoT gateway or other edge node where data is either transmitted to the cloud for analysis or analyzed locally.
 These devices often interact with other similar devices and act on the knowledge that they receive from each other. Much of the
 research is performed without human interference by the computers, although people may communicate with the devices — for example,
 set them up, send them instructions or access data.
The connectivity, networking, and communication protocols used with these web-enabled devices depend largely on the specific IoT applications used.
In addition, IoT can use artificial intelligence (AI ) and machine learning to help facilitate and dynamic data collection processes.
It's important to understand what the key pieces are, and how they bring the puzzle together, so let's.
An IoT system consists of sensors/devices that "chat" through some kind of connectivity to the cloud. If the data enters the cloud, the program processes it and may then decide to carry out an operation, such as sending an alarm or automatically modifying the sensors / devices without the user having to.
So if the user feedback is needed or the user just needs to check in on the program, a user interface enables them to do so. Any changes or actions taken by the user are then transmitted through the device in the opposite direction: from the user interface, to the cloud,to the cloud, and back to the sensors/devices to make some kind of change.</p>

<h2>IoT Sensors</h2>
Through IoT, the "things" come to life due to the sensors. Let's take an example of IoT operation, where a computer is being controlled for heating. In a standard example, a heat sensor would display the temperature on an analog or digital screen and an alarm would be raised when the heating rises above a threshold and someone would monitor it physically or at a more advanced stage. You would need to be next to the warning to take action.
Furthermore, in an IoT environment, this sensor could send a message to a decision engine with rules for taking action.These IoT sensors have several forms including temperature , humidity, sound, CO2, light, occupancy, motion, and more. What is important is that these sensors are an integral part of the components of the IoT device. They are the sources of reality, and can make things function when associated with a decision engine.</p> 
<h2>Connectivity / Network</h2>
<p>Let's get to learn how they interact with the decision engine now that we understand the sensor technologies in IoT and what they do.
Engines to take decisions are not fresh. They were in existence in the form of PLC's for a few decades. Many of those links were connected to the decision engines. With the rise in sensors and the proliferation of these in various devices and computers, communicating wirelessly became increasingly necessary.
In recent years numerous protocols of communication using radio frequency technology have emerged. Bluetooth Low Energy BLE, LoRa, ZigBee, SigFox and NB-IoT, are some of the most commonly used technologies.</p>
<h2>IoT Cloud</h2>
<p>Now that we have been able to send the data to the cloud, let's try to understand what the IoT Cloud is and how it is an important part of understanding how IoT works.
Usually, IoT sensors are resource-constrained, and require a destination where data can be sent. Those IoT sensors generally use a MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) protocol to transmit data. MQTT functions like a broker who receives and transfers details on a subject to everyone who subscribes to it. This MQTT server is also widely called the IoT server. Rules are usually set on this server so that data can be filtered when it enters.</p>
<h2>Hyper Decision Framework – ISAE</h2>
<p>The hyper-decision system is a collection of rules built within a hyper-speed rule generator. Analyzing the information received and mapping this information against a set of rules that could overlap with one another and executing the rule-related decision is what we call the hyper decision framework.
You might find, as another example, that in some movie theaters when the theater isn't full, the temperature inside may be lower than comfortable, so when the theater is full, you 'd like the temperature to be a little lower to make it comfortable.That is because the HVAC delivers the same volume of ventilation, regardless of the number of people inside the theater. Through using our Occupancy IoT Sensor, we could send the number of people in the theater to the Hyper Decision Engine and it could control the airflow automatically, thus not only reducing the cost but also enhancing our experience of watching movies.</p>
<h2>User Interface</h2>
<p>Lastly, this whole device needs to have an gui. It can usually manifest as a desktop application, and can also be used as a web-based application. It will help in presenting the solution with the Computer to People app.
This interface will help the user communicate with the device, as in home automation, the given user interface will help the user turn on or off the lights or fans in a specific room. For an industrial application, the shop floor manager can monitor a machine directly from the data inputs.</p>
